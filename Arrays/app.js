//Arrays
//The array is a object than can let you stroe multiple values in a single variable[collection of elements].
//The location of an item in an array. ... Note: In most programming languages, the first array index is 0 or 1, and indexes continue through the natural numbers. The upper bound of an array is generally language and possibly system specific.

let friend1 = "Cristian";
let friend2 = "John";
let friend3 = "Spider-Man";
let friend4 = "Cristiano Ronaldo";

let friends = new Array("Cristian","John","Spider-Man","Cristiano Ronaldo");

let oldFriends = ["Cr7",66,true,null,undefined];

console.log(friends[3]); //-> The output is Cristiano Ronaldo witch is in position 3 in the index of that array.
